# Kosaraju’s algorithm
Kosaraju’s algorithm is an efficient method for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph. The algorithm performs two depth-first searches: 
1. the first search constructs a list of nodes according to the structure of the graph, 
2. and the second search forms the strongly connected components.
