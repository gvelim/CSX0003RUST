# Kruskal's MST Algorithm
In Kruskalâ€™s algorithm, we start with the spanning tree containing **only** the nodes of the graph and with no any edges connecting the nodes. 

Then the algorithm goes through, adding the edges one at a time, ordered by their weights, and as long as the edge is not creating a cycle.

## Approach
The algorithm maintains the components of the tree. Initially, each node of the graph belongs to a separate component. As shown below there are six components since none of the nodes are connected.

![Step 1 - Number of components equal to number of nodes](img/mst_step1.png)

Always when an edge is added to the tree, two components are joined as in the below example where nodes `5` and `6` form a new component

![Step 2 - merging up components one edge at a time](img/mst_step2.png)

Finally, all nodes belong to the same component, and a minimum spanning tree has been found

![Step 3 - MST as a single component](img/mst_step3.png)

Overall the approach can be summarised as following
1. **Phase 1**: Sort Edges by minimum cost first
2. **Phase 2**: Build Minimum Spanning Tree
   1. While there are more than `one` components
      1. Retrieve edge with the lowest weight `(src,dst)`
      2. Find component for `src`, let's say it is `src'`
      3. Find component for `dst`, let's say it is `dst'`
      4. if `src'` is different to `dst'` then
         1. Merge `src'` and `dst'`
         2. Add edge `(src,dst)` into the graph

### Super Nodes as Components
The `SuperNodes` struct used to solve the **minimum cut** algorithm is more or less the right tool in this instance given that the definition of a `super node` is synonymous to a graph component.

The `SuperNodes` structure, provides us with the
* merging of two super node components into a super node
  * finding of the super node component that a given node belongs to
```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../src/graphs/min_cut.rs:graphs_min_cut_super_nodes}}
```
### BinaryHeap for edge Ordering
To provide an ordered edge list we use the `BinaryHeap` collection that uses the edge's `weight` as the prioritisation key. The following `Step` implementation provide us with the desirable result.
```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../src/greedy/mod.rs:graphs_mst_step}}
```
Additionally, we have the following helper `Graph` functions that provide us with 
* the ordered edge list
* the sum of weights for all edges in the graph
* adding an edge into the graph
```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../src/greedy/mod.rs:graphs_mst_graph}}
```

## Implementation
As a result, the following implementation consolidates all of the above into the Kruskal's algorithm implementation.
```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../src/greedy/mod.rs:graphs_mst}}
```
