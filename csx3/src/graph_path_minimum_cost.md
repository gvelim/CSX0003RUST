# Minimum Path Cost Algorithm
Here we cover problems involving finding the shortest path between vertices in a
graph with weights (lengths) on the edges. One obvious application is in finding the shortest
route from one address to another, however shortest paths have many other application[^note] 

## Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstraâ€™s is an important algorithm both because it is an efficient algorithm for an important problem, but
also because it is a very elegant example of an efficient greedy algorithm that generates optimal
solutions on a nontrivial task.

The below animated image demonstrated how the algorithm works

The above depiction performs the below steps 
* push the starting node `a` in the priority queue with cost `0`
* Pop the node with the lowest cost in the queue; at fist this is `a`
  * if the 'node' matches our target node `b` 
    * extract path with minimum cost 
    * terminate
  * For each `edge node` attached to the `node`
    * calculate `cost distance`
    * if `edge node` has `cost` larger to the calculated `cost distance` then assign cost to `edge node`, otherwise do not update cost
    * push `(edge node, cost)` to the priority queue and repeat

### Prioritised Queue
Dijkstra's differentiating approach is that we must always process next the node with the lowest cost in the queue. To achieve this we have to make use of the `BinaryHeap` collection structure. The use of such structure help us to maintain on ordered-queue by node-cost, hence keeping the node with lowest-cost at the top of the heap/queue.
```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../src/graphs/path_search.rs:graphs_search_path_utils_Step}}
```
### Implementation
With the ordered-queue logic in place, we still need to have the means to maintain the following information per node and while we are searching the graph 
* `node` state, in terms of processed / not processed
* `parent` node, that is, the node we visited from
* `unit` in terms of cost or distance

The `Tracker` structure simplifies managing the [node processing state](graph_search_process_state.md) of the graph, and we will use as part of our implementation.

As a result, the algorithm can now be realised through the following code
```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../src/graphs/path_search.rs:graphs_search_path_min_cost}}
```
