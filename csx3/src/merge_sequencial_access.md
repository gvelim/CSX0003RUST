# Sequential access against multiple slice segments
A `VirtualSlice` is composed out of one or more slice segments, adjacent to memory or not, and enables transparently operating over them.

The virtual slice operates in two modes. Adjacent and non-adjacent.

It addresses the following needs:

* Need to access two or more slices as a single continuous one
* Need to use memory efficiently for cases where such slices are adjacent in memory
* Need to perform a merge of two or more ordered slices

## Memory layout
### Non-Adjacent arrays Mode
```
Left Array       Right Array
+---+---+---+    +---+---+---+     
| 2 | 4 | 6 | <> | 1 | 3 | 5 |   Memory non-adjacent array segments
+---+---+---+    +---+---+---+     
  c       ^        j
          |__
       ...  | ...
+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| &2 | &4 | &6 | &1 | &3 | &5 |  Array of mutable references : Virtual Slice
+----+----+----+----+----+----+  i.e. &2 = pointer/reference to left array[0]
```
### Adjacent arrays Mode
```
    Left Array   Right Array
+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| +---+---+---++---+---+---+  |  VirtualSlice reconstructs the parent array   
| | 2 | 4 | 6 || 1 | 3 | 5 |  |  out of the two adjacent array segments for 
| +---+---+---++---+---+---+  |  sequencial access
+----+----+----+----+----+----+  
    c            j
```
## Examples
### Merging two adjacent slices O(n+m)
* No additional memory used for holding references
* Uses (n + m) * usize for dynamic indexing
    * can be further optimised to hold only (n) * size of additional memory
```rust,noplayground
use csx3::merge::vs::VirtualSlice;
let v = &mut [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
let (s1, s2) = v.split_at_mut(5);

let mut v = VirtualSlice::new_adjacent(s1)
v.merge(s2);

assert_eq!(s1, &mut [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
assert_eq!(s2, &mut [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
```

### Access & swap contents out of two non-adjacent slices
* Uses n + m memory for holding references
* Uses (n + m) * usize for dynamic indexing
```rust,noplayground
use csx3::merge::vs::VirtualSlice;

let s1 = &mut [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];
let _s3 = &mut [0, 0, 0, 0, 0];   // Stack wedge 
let s4 = &mut [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

let mut v = VirtualSlice::new();

v.attach(s1);
v.attach(s4);

v[0] = 11;
v[5] = 9;
v.swap(0, 5);

assert_eq!(s1, &mut [9, 3, 5, 7, 9]);
assert_eq!(s4, &mut [11, 4, 6, 8 , 10]);
```
